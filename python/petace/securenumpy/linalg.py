    """
    Inner product of two arrays.
    Ordinary inner product of vectors for 1-D arrays (without complex conjugation),
    in higher dimensions a sum product over the last axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a,b : SecureArray
        If a and b are nonscalar, their last dimensions must match.

    Returns
    -------
    out : SecureArray
        If a and b are both scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned;
        otherwise an array is returned. out.shape = (*a.shape[:-1], *b.shape[:-1])

    Dot product of two arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a,b : SecureArray
        If a and b are 1-D arrays, the dot product of the two arrays is returned.
        If a and b are 2-D arrays, the matrix product is returned.
        If a and b are n-D arrays, then the sum product over the last two axes

    Returns
    -------
    out : SecureArray
        The dot product of a and b.
