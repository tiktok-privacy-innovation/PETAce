# PETAce

<!-- start-petace-overview -->

Privacy-Enhancing Technologies via Applied Cryptography Engineering (PETAce) is a framework for privacy-preserving computing. It provides strong privacy guarantee by analytzing and computing cryptographically pseudonymized data without revealing hidden sensitive information. It consists of the following parts:

- The "user interface" layer provides users with high-level programming interfaces for collaborative data analysis (SecureNumpy), joint SQL query (SecureSQL), and privacy-preserving machine learning (SecureML).

- The "virtual machine" layer is responsible for parsing high-level language into secure multi-party computation (MPC) operators, and performing automatic optimization and scheduling.

- The "protocol" layer includes secure multi-party computation protocols, such as general-purpose two-party secure computation protocols, privacy set intersection, and privacy information retrieval, etc.

- The "primitive" layer consists of standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols, differential privacy mechanisms, and abstract network interfaces, etc.

PETAce enables fast prototyping of ideas based on privacy-enhancing technologies, and we plan to integrate state-of-the-art research results into the PETAce in future releases. Its core modules are implemented in C++ and are modularized into the following repositories.

- [PETAce-Solo](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Solo) implements primitive hashing, encryption, and randomness generation algorithms performed by one party.
    - Hash functions: SHA-256, SHA3-256, and BLAKE2b
    - Psuedo-random number generators based on: SHAKE_128, BLAKE2Xb, and AES_ECB_CTR.
    - Sampling of bytes, 32-bit unsigned integers, and 64-bit unsigned integers from the uniform distribution
    - Prime field elliptic curve group arithmetics including hash-to-curve
    - Hashing tables: Cuckoo hashing and simple hashing
    - Partially homomorphic encryption: the Paillier cryptosystem
- [PETAce-Verse](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Verse) includes frequently used cryptographic subprotocols such as oblivious transfer and oblivious shuffling.

## Building PETAce

The commands presented below should be executed in the root directory of PETAce.

First, build [JSON for Modern C++ (JSON)](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) using the following scripts.
Assume that JSON is cloned into the directory `${JSON}`.

```bash
cmake -B ${JSON}/build -S ${JSON}
cmake --build ${JSON}/build -j
```

Then, build PETAce library:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -Dnlohmann_json_DIR=${JSON}/build -DPETACE_BUILD_PYTHON=ON
cmake --build build
cd build
make wheel
```

Output binaries can be found in `build/python/wheel/` directory.

| Compile Options            | Values        | Default | Description                                         |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`         | Release/Debug | Release | Debug mode decreases run-time performance.          |
